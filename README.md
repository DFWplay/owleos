OWL EOS Wallet is easy to use. Here are some scenarios for using it:

## 1. Registration.
At the first start you will be asked to come up with and enter a password, as well as a private account key. It is stored in an encrypted form and access to it will be possible only with the use of the specified password.

## 2. Adding a new account/wallet
Account is added to the link on the first screen of the application. Adding a new account is similar to registering.

## 3. Execute an action
Go to Actions tab and select action. Fill the form and send transaction. If entered data correctly, account info will be updated and new history records will be added.
There are following actions:
- transfer EOS
- stake EOS
- unstake EOS
- buy RAM
- sell RAM
- create account

## 4. Create account action
You can create new EOS account if you have some unstaked EOS. You should buy 3 or more Kb RAM and set account name and *public* key (from key pair)
